            <p>
              (c) SWYNG believes that the user&#39;s actions may infringe on any third party rights or breach any applicable law or otherwise result in any liability for the user, other users of the website and/or SWYNG.
            </p>
            <p>
              SWYNG may at any time in its sole discretion reinstate suspended users. Once the user has been indefinitely suspended the user may not register or attempt to register with SWYNG or use the website in any manner whatsoever until such time that the user is reinstated by SWYNG. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the user breaches this agreement, the TOS or the documents it incorporates by reference, SWYNG reserves the right to recover any amounts due and owing by the user to SWYNG and/or the service provider and to take strict legal action as SWYNG deems necessary.
